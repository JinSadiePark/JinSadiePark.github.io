Creating visually appealing graphs in Python is a valuable skill for anyone looking to convey data-driven insights effectively. In this tutorial, we will delve into data visualization with Python, exploring Seaborn and Matplotlib. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or just someone passionate about presenting data in a compelling way, you'll discover how to craft stunning and informative graphs that bring your data to life.

When we create graphs there are a couple of things to consider.
Are we using categorical data or numerical data?
Are we creating the graph based on one feature or multiple features?

<h2><strong>One Categorical Feature</strong></h2>
We can use a bar chart for this. The categories are typically displayed on the x-axis while the height or length of the bars on the y-axis represents the frequency, count, or any other quantitative measure associated with each category.
